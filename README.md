## Overview

### The challenge

Building out a very simple order summary card using HTML + CSS.

Users should be able to:

- See a responsive design that adapts to the size of their viewport
- See hover states for interactive elements (buttons, links)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This was a very simple project so there isn't really much that I believe I could have done differently. Something to explore in the future would be to restructure the layout using CSS grid alongside Flexbox.
